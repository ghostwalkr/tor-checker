# TOR Checker
Checks if an IP address is a TOR exit node

TOR checker is a tool for checking if an IPv4 address is a TOR exit node. It checks https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses.
It's tested on Ubuntu 18.04.1. It should work on most Linux-based systems. Feel free to try it and let me know if it does/doesn't work.

## Dependencies
* Either wget or curl

## Usage
`./tor_check <ip>`
